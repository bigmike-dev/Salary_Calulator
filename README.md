# Salary_Calulator
This was a fun one to do!! I created a rudementary salary calculator a couple of times, improving the code each time. This time around I, I learned about the @property 
decorator which allows me to treat each method like an attribute without having to call each method individually. That really cleaned up a good chunk of the code. 
I also had to do a bit of troubleshooting as I normally would use () for the methods but discovered that the property decorator eliminates this need as well. 

This definiely looks cleaner and sleeker than the original attempts at this code. I may even go back later and see if I can clean it up further or even add more to it!
